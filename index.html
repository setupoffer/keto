To find the Goldilocks zone for fertilizing containers, take the recommended dosage for the product you’re using, and divide it by how frequently you’ll be fertilizing. For example, if the recommended amount is one “scoop” per month, divide the amount by 2 for bi-weekly feedings, and by 4 for weekly fertilizing. Over-fertilizing can cause plant leaves to turn yellow or brown, and damages roots. “Burning” is caused by the naturally occurring salts in fertilizers, which draw moisture out of the plant.}</p>

Although if you see any weeds crop up, remove the source immediately. A variety of flowers is fine, but you want to avoid planting every species or turning it into a confusing fever dream of colors. Ensure the garden paths are spacious and free from overhanging plants. When selecting plants for your garden, consider going with a certain theme or color scheme.}</p>
